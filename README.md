# Imagery

Imagery lets you generate images using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) based on text or image input.

Currently in development, see issues.

# How to Build

Open GNOME Builder (or Visual Studio Code with Flatpak extension), and run it from there.

The models are downloaded within the app.
